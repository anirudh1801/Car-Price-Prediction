# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning ðŸš—ðŸ’°
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting car prices based on various factors such as brand, features, horsepower, mileage, and more. Car price prediction is a significant area of research in the field of machine learning and provides valuable insights for buyers and sellers.

# Project Overview
Predicting the price of a car involves analyzing multiple attributes that contribute to its valuation. This project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model to predict car prices effectively. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to achieve accurate predictions.

# Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding data distributions and relationships.
- Feature selection: Identifying the most impactful features for price prediction.
- Model training: Implementing and comparing various machine learning algorithms.
- Model evaluation: Assessing performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.

# Requirements
The project is implemented using Python and requires the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository, raise issues, or submit pull requests to improve the project.
